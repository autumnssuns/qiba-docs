# Legislative Requirements

<!-- 
EEO and Fair Work laws

EEO: Equal Employment Opportunity
Fair Work: Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)
 -->

Both **Age** and **Racial Discrimination Acts** aim to provide **equal employment opportunities (EEO)**, making it unlawful to, based on age or cultural background:

- Hire, fire, or treat someone unfairly
- Harass or bully someone
- Deny or limit access to services, resources or benefits

[**Fair Work Act 2009**](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/legislation) provides safety net of **minimum entitlements** and **fairness at work**, covering unfair dismissal, bullying and general protections.
