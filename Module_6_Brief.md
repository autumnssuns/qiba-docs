# üò´ Competitors

Mostly <highlight>Online Retailers</highlight>, e.g., Amazon, Booktopia, etc:

- **Wider selection** of products to choose from
- **Convenience** of online shopping
- **Lower prices** due to bulk purchasing from worldwide suppliers
- **Better shopping experience** with recommendations, shopping history
- **Easy payment** options (card, PayPal, etc.)
- **Lower operation costs**, no physical store, fewer staff

Some customers <highlight>read in store</highlight> but <highlight>buy online</highlight> at a different retailer for cheaper prices.

- **No policy** to prevent this

---

# üòµ‚Äçüí´ Marketing Efforts

<highlight>Limited</highlight>:

- Local newspapers advertisements
- Monthly catalogues new books

<highlight>Simple website</highlight> with basic information: [Book Nook](https://autumnssuns.github.io/qiba-docs/book-nook-site)

- **Store location** and **trading hours**
- **Doesn't function** properly
- No **online store**

<highlight>Cannot reach young customers</highlight>
