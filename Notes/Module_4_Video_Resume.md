Hi there, thank you for taking the time to watch this video. I understand that you are getting a lot of applications, so I hope this video will be a refreshing change of pace.

<!-- Cut to next scene -->

I am Dan Tran, and I am excited to apply for the Solutions Developer position in the Digital Business Solutions team of QUT's Administrative Division. I was referred to this position by my colleague, Jake Bradford, who believes that it would be the perfect next step in my career, which I totally agree!

From my understanding, you are looking for a well-organised individual who is an expert in web technologies with a strong focus on user experience. It is also important that this person is a team player who brings a positive attitude to the workplace.

One other requirement that caught my attention was the need for 4 years of professional experience. Admittedly, having just graduated in December 2023, I only possess 3 years of work experience, most of which was gained during my time as a student. However, I believe that my diverse experiences make up for this gap, as I have been involved in teaching 10 units at QUT, most prominently programming and software development units. At the same time, I have also been developing multiple projects using web technologies in the learning and teaching space, and I believe my ability to adapt and learn quickly will quickly bridge this gap.

<!-- Cut to next scene: Professional Qualities -->

If there is one thing that I am proud of, it is surely my work ethic and my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new environments. This is evident in my GPA of 7.0, despite the competing timelines of teaching and project work. This also reflects my strong planning and organisational skills. At the time of making this video, I am juggling 7 units and 2 software projects with different requirements. Thankfully, I have managed to keep everything on track and to a high standard, and I'm sure all of my supervisors would back me up on this.

<!-- Cut to next scene: Technical experience -->

As a software developer, I have always been passionate about creating productivity-enhancing tools to deliver actual value to users.

For example, in my web development project for a student support service, STiMulate, I am responsible for the design, development and maintenance of the application. One of my key achievements was merging the different timetables of the teams into a single, easy-to-use interface that is now the landing page for the application. Currently, if anyone wish to look for support with CAB201, they can simply enter the code into the search bar. By comparison, the previous system require users to navigate through multiple pages to find the same information.

<!-- Cut to the next scene: Communication skills -->

Unlike a stereotypical programmer, I pride myself on my ability to communicate, evident in my teaching experience. Specifically, I have been teaching programming and software development units at QUT since 2022. This has allowed me to develop my communication skills and my ability to explain complex concepts in a simple and engaging manner.

The experience also required me to understand students' requirements, resulting in the development of high-quality learning materials, appreciated by both students and staff. For example, using a custom-built tool integrating with the Canvas API, I was able to effectively develop Canvas pages with a consistent layout and design, just like the one you are seeing right now.

<!-- Cut to the next scene: Personal side -->

Now, on a more personal note, I am a huge fan of video games. I got into programming because of my interest in modding games, and I still enjoy it to this day. I also love cooking, especially Asian cuisine, and I find it to be a great way to relax and unwind after a long day.
