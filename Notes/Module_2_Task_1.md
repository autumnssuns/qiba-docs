# Research about Australian Legislation which impacts on Diversity

In Queensland, Australia, workplace bullying is addressed under various legislations and resources. Here's a summary of the key points:

- **Workplace Bullying Definition**: It is defined as repeated and unreasonable behaviour directed towards a worker or group of workers that creates a risk to health and safety¹.
- **Examples of Bullying**: This can include abusive language, unjustified criticism, deliberately excluding someone from workplace activities, setting unreasonable deadlines, or spreading misinformation¹².
- **What Isn’t Bullying**: Single incidents of unreasonable behaviour, reasonable management actions carried out in a lawful and reasonable way, acts of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment, and workplace conflict are not considered bullying¹².
- **Legislation**: The **Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Qld)** deals with workplace bullying complaints, and the **Fair Work Commission** handles applications for orders to stop workplace bullying under the **Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth)**³⁴.
- **Managing Risks**: Employers are responsible for managing the risks of bullying in the workplace and ensuring a safe work environment².
