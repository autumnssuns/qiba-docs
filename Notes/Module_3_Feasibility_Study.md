# PY Reporting to Manager

## Scenario

At a project team meeting this week, the Director, Digital Research and Design, Mel Wisdom, mentioned that the organisation is investigating the Australian Education Market. Based on their research and subsequent inferences, Nickel-Byte Pty Ltd aims to design and launch a nationwide mobile and web application that can link **users/customers** (both international education providers and individual international students) with the latest information, experiences and services of **owners/sponsors** (Australian businesses and government departments of interest to the international student market).

One example use would be: advertising casual, short term employment for international students with a work permit. Or international students offering their labour skills per hour and location. Another example would be: listing cafes and accommodation with special discounts for international students. “Cheapest coffee today in Brisbane CBD’. Newly arrived students would also be interested in tourism discounts and up to date public transport information. Government departments could use the app to update international students about new regulations.

Mel mentioned that this proposed app is still at an early concept stage and the go ahead or ultimate design features of the app will largely depend on further information to be gathered. Mel asked you and another project team member (both of international student background) to do a feasibility study into the potential usefulness and viability of such a mobile application.

Mel Wisdom has given a 2 week timeframe for this feasibility study and wants a verbal progress report in one week’s time.

These features are designed to address the current needs and enhance the overall experience of international students in Australia, making their transition and stay more comfortable and informed. The app’s content and topics should be regularly updated based on user feedback and changing market dynamics to remain relevant and useful.

### Consideration 3: Who are the **main owners/sponsors** of the app and what benefits will they derive (return on investment)?

The main owners/sponsors of the app are likely to be local businesses, service providers, employers, accommodation agents, and possibly government departments that are interested in reaching and serving the international student market in Australia. The benefits they can expect to derive from their investment in the app include:

1. **[Increased Visibility**: By featuring on the app, sponsors can increase their brand exposure to a targeted audience of international students1](https://tinyscreenlabs.com/mobile-app-sponsorship/).
2. **[Direct Marketing**: The app provides a direct channel to promote products, services, and job opportunities to international students who are actively seeking such information](https://tinyscreenlabs.com/mobile-app-sponsorship/)[2](https://mobileup.io/realize-the-possibilities-of-in-app-sponsorships/).

5. **[Competitive Advantage**: Being early sponsors of the app could give businesses a first-mover advantage in the international student market](https://tinyscreenlabs.com/mobile-app-sponsorship/)[3](https://www.sponsorunited.com/sponsorship-101/six-key-benefits-of-sponsorships).
6. **[Customer Engagement**: The app can facilitate engagement with international students, fostering loyalty and potentially leading to word-of-mouth referrals](https://tinyscreenlabs.com/mobile-app-sponsorship/)[3](https://www.sponsorunited.com/sponsorship-101/six-key-benefits-of-sponsorships).
7. **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Sponsors will look for a positive ROI, which could be in the form of increased sales, customer acquisition, or brand equity. [Many brands aim for a 2:1 or higher ROI ratio for their sponsorship investments](https://tinyscreenlabs.com/mobile-app-sponsorship/)[4](https://www.eventbrite.com/blog/sponsorship-roi-ds00/).

To record opinions and gauge the appetite for the proposed app among potential sponsors, a survey tool can be very useful. There are several online survey tools available that can help collect this data efficiently. [Some popular options include Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, and Typeform, which offer a range of features for creating and distributing surveys to gather feedback](https://tinyscreenlabs.com/mobile-app-sponsorship/)[5](https://www.surveymanager.com.au/blog/the-11-best-online-survey-tools-in-australia-for-gathering-data-and-feedback/)[6](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/survey-software)[7](https://zapier.com/blog/best-survey-apps/)[8](https://zight.com/blog/online-survey-tools/)[9](https://www.capterra.com/resources/top-survey-software/). These tools can help you design a questionnaire that captures the perspectives of potential sponsors on the app’s concept, features, and potential benefits for their businesses.

### Consideration 4: Is the app useful enough to attract **payment** from the user? From the sponsor? Subscription fee?

Determining the app’s potential to attract payment from users and sponsors, and whether a subscription fee is viable, involves several factors:

1. **Value Proposition**: The app must offer significant value to users, such as unique features or services that are not readily available elsewhere. [This could include exclusive job listings, discounts, or educational content tailored to international students1](https://medium.com/technology-buzz/app-monetization-strategies-from-freemium-to-subscription-models-0d7430b82163).
2. **Market Demand**: There needs to be a clear demand for the app’s services. [Market research and user feedback can help assess this demand and shape the app’s offerings to meet user needs](https://medium.com/technology-buzz/app-monetization-strategies-from-freemium-to-subscription-models-0d7430b82163)[2](https://www.amity.co/blog/20-app-monetization-stats-you-should-know).
3. **Competitive Pricing**: The pricing model must be competitive and align with what users are willing to pay. [Research shows that users are generally more inclined to pay for apps that offer high perceived value and usefulness3](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/APJML-06-2019-0411/full/html).
4. **Sponsor Interest**: Sponsors will invest if they see a direct benefit, such as increased visibility or access to a niche market. [The app must demonstrate its reach and effectiveness in engaging international students](https://medium.com/technology-buzz/app-monetization-strategies-from-freemium-to-subscription-models-0d7430b82163)[4](https://blog.mimio.com/7-of-the-biggest-investors-in-ed-tech-why-it-matters-to-you).
5. **Monetization Strategy**: The app’s monetization strategy should be carefully crafted. Options include in-app advertising, freemium models, paid versions, and subscriptions. [Each has its own set of advantages and challenges that need to be considered1](https://medium.com/technology-buzz/app-monetization-strategies-from-freemium-to-subscription-models-0d7430b82163)[2](https://www.amity.co/blog/20-app-monetization-stats-you-should-know).
6. **User Experience**: The monetization model should not detract from the user experience. [Users are more likely to pay for apps that are user-friendly, reliable, and provide a seamless experience](https://medium.com/technology-buzz/app-monetization-strategies-from-freemium-to-subscription-models-0d7430b82163)[5](https://www.startechup.com/blog/9-app-monetization-strategies/).
7. **Sponsor ROI**: Sponsors will look for a return on investment, which could be in the form of increased sales, customer engagement, or brand loyalty. [The app needs to provide metrics or projections to demonstrate potential ROI](https://medium.com/technology-buzz/app-monetization-strategies-from-freemium-to-subscription-models-0d7430b82163)[6](https://mobileup.io/realize-the-possibilities-of-in-app-sponsorships/).
8. **Regulatory Compliance**: Especially for educational apps, compliance with regulations and data protection laws is crucial. [This can affect the app’s ability to monetize certain features or content](https://medium.com/technology-buzz/app-monetization-strategies-from-freemium-to-subscription-models-0d7430b82163)[7](https://www.elegantmedia.com.au/blog/10-ways-find-investors-for-your-app-idea-in-australia/).
9. **[User Feedback**: Early user testing and feedback can provide insights into the app’s usefulness and the willingness of users to pay for its services8](https://www.cccreative.design/blogs/how-much-are-users-willing-to-pay-for-app-subscriptions).
10. **[Sponsor Feedback**: Similarly, potential sponsors’ feedback can indicate their interest in investing in the app and the types of sponsorship or advertising models they prefer6](https://mobileup.io/realize-the-possibilities-of-in-app-sponsorships/).

While it is challenging to determine the app’s financial viability before development, these factors can guide the creation of a monetization strategy that appeals to both users and sponsors. Surveys, focus groups, and market analysis can provide the necessary data to make informed decisions about pricing and monetization models.

### Consideration 5: Can the app be funded from **paid advertising**? How would this be integrated?

Yes, the app can indeed be funded through paid advertising, and when integrated thoughtfully, it can be a significant source of revenue without being overly intrusive for users. Here’s how paid advertising can be integrated into the app:

1. **[Strategic Ad Placement**: Ads can be placed at natural stopping points within the app, such as between different sections or features, to minimize disruption to the user experience1](https://www.builder.ai/blog/in-app-advertising).
2. **[Targeted Advertising**: By leveraging user data, ads can be highly targeted to the interests and behaviors of the users, increasing the relevance and effectiveness of the ads1](https://www.builder.ai/blog/in-app-advertising).
3. **[Ad Formats**: A variety of ad formats can be used, such as banner ads, interstitial ads, video ads, and native ads, which can blend more seamlessly with the app’s content2](https://www.adjust.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-in-app-advertising/).
4. **[User Engagement**: Interactive ad formats like playable ads or rich media can enhance user engagement, making the ads a part of the app experience rather than a distraction1](https://www.builder.ai/blog/in-app-advertising).
5. **[Frequency Capping**: Limiting the number of times an ad is shown to the same user can prevent ad fatigue and maintain a positive user experience1](https://www.builder.ai/blog/in-app-advertising).
6. **[Ad Customization**: Allowing users to set preferences for the types of ads they see can improve their experience and the effectiveness of the ads1](https://www.builder.ai/blog/in-app-advertising).
7. **[Incentivized Ads**: Offering rewards for watching ads, such as in-app currency or discounts, can make users more receptive to advertising2](https://www.adjust.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-in-app-advertising/).
8. **[Quality Control**: Ensuring that the ads are of high quality and relevant to the app’s content can improve user perception and acceptance of the ads1](https://www.builder.ai/blog/in-app-advertising).

By carefully considering the user experience and the needs of the sponsors, paid advertising can be a win-win solution. Service providers and government agencies can benefit from targeted exposure, while the app can generate the necessary revenue to support its development and maintenance. The key is to strike the right balance between monetization and user satisfaction.

### Consideration 6: What is the **potential number of users nationally** and what uptake can we expect?

The potential number of users for the app, which targets international students in Australia, can be estimated based on the latest available data:

- [As of January 2024, there were **582,636 enrolments** by international students in Australia, incorporating enrolments carried over from 2023 and new commencements1](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-numbers-country-state-and-territory)[2](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-monthly-summary-and-data-tables).
- [The number of international student enrolments was **746,387** in December 2022, indicating that one student may enroll in more than one course](https://www.education.gov.au/international-education-data-and-research/international-student-numbers-country-state-and-territory)[3](https://www.studying-in-australia.org/international-students-in-australia-statistics/).

Considering these figures, the potential national user base for the app could be in the range of **582,636 to 746,387** international students, depending on the overlap of enrolments and individual students.

As for the uptake, it’s challenging to predict exact numbers before the app’s development and release. However, factors that can influence uptake include:

- **Market Need**: If the app addresses a significant need or gap in the market, uptake is likely to be higher.
- **Marketing and Promotion**: Effective marketing strategies can significantly boost initial uptake.
- **User Experience**: A positive user experience, including ease of use and valuable features, can lead to higher adoption rates.
- **Word of Mouth**: Recommendations from peers and user reviews can greatly influence uptake among international students.
- **Incentives**: Offering incentives for early adopters or for referrals can increase uptake.

For a new app, a conservative estimate for uptake in the first year might range from **5% to 10%** of the potential user base, provided the app is well-received and marketed effectively. This would translate to approximately **29,132 to 74,639** users in the first year, based on the potential user base numbers. These estimates should be refined with more specific market research and analysis as part of the feasibility study.

### Consideration 7: How can its popularity be further boosted?

Boosting the popularity of an app involves a multi-faceted approach that includes both organic and paid strategies. Here are some effective methods to consider:

1. **[App Store Optimization (ASO)**: Improve the app’s visibility in app stores by optimizing the title, description, keywords, and visuals to rank higher in search results1](https://www.businessofapps.com/insights/guide-to-app-growth-strategy/).

Being at the early concept stage, this study will begin with an overview of the main customers / users of the app and their requirement, followed by the main features of the app, the main owners/sponsors, and the benefits they will derive. The report will also explore the potential for the app to attract payment from users and sponsors, the feasibility of funding through paid advertising, and the potential number of users nationally and expected uptake. It will conclude with recommendations for the app's development and launch in order to boost its popularity and maximize its success.

## The International Student Market in Australia

### Statistical Data

The main customers/users of the app are international students in Australia, who have a diverse range of needs and preferences in all aspects of their daily life. Before diving into the specific requirements of these users, it is essential to understand the market size and composition of international students in Australia through statistical data, obtained from the Department of Education, Australian Government.

Firstly, the following bar chart illustrates the trend of international student enrolments in Australia over the past few years:

![alt text](Enrolment_Bars.png)

It is evident that the number of international student experienced a decline in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has been steadily increasing since then, reaching historic highs in 2024 with 582636 enrolments (including an all-time high of 59233 new commencements in January 2024). This is a significant market size that presents a valuable opportunity for the proposed app.

In terms of the demographic composition, the following pie chart shows the top ten source countries for international students in Australia, with other countries grouped under "Other":

![alt text](Pie_Chart_Nationality.png)

It can be seen that China (20%), India (17%), Nepal (9%), Philippines (6%), and Vietnam (5%) are the top five source countries for international students in Australia, accounting for 57% of the total enrolments. This diversity in nationalities highlights the need for an app that caters to the unique needs and preferences of students from various cultural backgrounds.

Finally, to have a better understanding of their lifestyle and preferences, the following pie chart shows the distribution of international student enrolments by sector:

![alt text](Sector_Distribution.png)

Amongst the five sectors, Higher Education is the most popular choice for international students, accounting for 50% of the total enrolments, followed by Vocational Education and Training (VET) at 35%, English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) at 10%, and Schools at 3%. By understanding that the majority of international students are enrolled in Higher Education and VET courses, the app can tailor its features and services to meet the specific needs of these students, as well as find opportunities to collaborate with educational institutions in these sectors.

### User Requirements

By understanding that the majority of the user base consists of international students, mostly from East, South, and Southeast Asia who are mostly pursuing Higher Education and VET courses, it is possible to narrow down the requirements of the application to the following areas, targetting the needs of young adults studying in Australia:

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ease of Use** | Intuitive design and user-friendly interface |
| **Language Support** | Multiple languages or in-app translation |
| **Cultural Sensitivity** | Inclusive content and services |
| **Employment Opportunities** | Job listings compatible with student visa work restrictions |
| **Discounts and Deals** | Exclusive offers on food, accommodation, and tourism |
| **Educational Content** | Resources and tools for academic success |
| **Social Integration** | Networking and community building features |
| **Safety and Security** | Secure login, privacy controls, and emergency services information |
| **Real-Time Updates** | Public transport, regulations, and critical information |
| **Feedback Mechanism** | User feedback on app features and services |

These requirements are essential to ensure that the app meets the specific needs and preferences of international students in Australia, enhancing their overall experience and satisfaction.

## Sponsors Benefits and Requirements

Having identified the main users, it is crucial to understand the needs of the sponsors of the app. They are most likely to be local businesses, service providers, employers, and government departments interested in reaching and serving the international student market in Australia. 

### Benefits

The following table outlines the potential benefits that sponsors can derive from their investment in the app:

| Benefit | Description | Example Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Increased Visibility** | Enhanced brand exposure to a targeted audience | Local cafe showcasing its menu |
| **Direct Marketing** | Direct channel to promote products and services | Accommodation provider advertising their properties and services |
| **Brand Association** | Enhanced brand image through association with the app | Sponsor icon displayed on the app's homepage alongside other reputable brands |
| **Data Insights** | Valuable user data for future marketing strategies | Analysis of user demographics and preferences, alongside engagement metrics |
| **Competitive Advantage** | First-mover advantage in the international student market | First sponsor gets exclusive promotion for a limited time |
| **Customer Engagement** | Increased engagement and loyalty among users | Government department broadcasting updates and notifications regarding visa regulations |

Ultimately, sponsors will be looking for a positive return on investment (ROI) from their sponsorship, which could be in the form of increased sales, customer acquisition, or brand equity. In the case of government departments, the ROI could be measured in terms of improved engagement with international students and better compliance with regulations.

### Sponsor Requirements

To attract sponsors and ensure their continued support, the app must meet certain requirements that align with their goals and objectives. These requirements include:

- **Audience Reach**: The app must have a significant user base of international students to justify the investment.
- **Engagement Options**: Sponsors should have various engagement options, such as in-app advertising, sponsored content, and direct marketing channels.
- **Data Analytics**: The app should provide sponsors with valuable user data and insights to inform their marketing strategies.
- **Brand Visibility**: Sponsors should receive prominent visibility within the app to maximize brand exposure.
- **Compliance**: The app must comply with relevant regulations and data protection laws to ensure sponsors' trust and confidence.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Sponsors should have a feedback mechanism to provide input on the app's features and services.

By meeting these requirements and delivering on the promised benefits, the app can attract and retain sponsors, ensuring its long-term sustainability and success.

## Features

To create interest and incentivise users to engage with the app, it is essential to identify the core features that will provide value to both international students and sponsors. It is also important to consider the technical feasibility and cost implications of developing these features, especially if such features are already available in the market.

### Existing Services by Competitors

In general, most of the features that are beneficial to international students are already available in the market through various apps and services, as shown in the following table:

| Feature | Description | Example Existing Services |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Job Listings** | Platform for advertising casual and short-term employment | Seek, Indeed, LinkedIn |
| **Discounts and Deals** | Special offers from local businesses | Groupon, Student Edge |
| **Accommodation Services** | Help in finding affordable housing options | Domain, Flatmates, Airbnb |
| **Public Transport Information** | Real-time updates and navigation assistance | Google Maps, Moovit, Translink |
| **Educational Resources** | Tools for academic support | Grammarly, Turnitin, Duolingo |

| **Legal and Regulatory Updates** | Notifications about changes in regulations | Department of Home Affairs, Study in Australia |
| **Emergency Services** | Quick access to emergency contacts and safety information | Triple Zero (000), SafeZone |
| **Personal Finance Management** | Budgeting tools and financial literacy resources | CommBank, Pocketbook, MoneyBrilliant |

It is evident that there are a variety of existing services that cater to the needs of international students in Australia, each offering unique features and benefits. However, the seer volume of these services indicates a saturated market, making it extremely challenging for a new app to stand out and attract users for a specific aspect of life, invalidating the idea of an all-in-one app.

### Proposal: Integration Hub

To address the challenge of creating an all-in-one app, a proposed solution is to prioritise integration over aggregation. Inspired by Centrelink's authentication system, the app could serve as an integration hub that allows other services and product owners (clients) to integrate their own apps with the platform. This would enable users to connect using their social accounts (Facebook, Google, etc.) and access a news platform for each client, providing a seamless experience for users while allowing businesses and government departments to reach their target audience effectively.

To achieve such a solution, the following features would be essential:

- **Authentication System**: Secure login and authentication for users and clients.
  - **Social Account Integration**: Connect using existing social accounts for ease of access.
  - **Linking Services**: Allow users to link their accounts with client apps for personalised experiences.
- **API Integration**: Application Programming Interface (API) for clients to integrate their apps with the platform, facilitating operations such as:
  - **User Data Sharing**: Sharing user data between the app and client apps.
  - **Content Syndication**: Syndicating news and updates from clients to the app.
  - **Engagement Metrics**: Tracking user engagement and interactions with client content.
  - **Feedback Reporting**: Providing feedback and insights to clients on user interactions.
- **News Platform**: A dedicated platform for each client to publish news, updates, and promotions for users.
- **In-App Translation**: Multi-language support for clients to reach a diverse audience.
- **Advertising Opportunities**: In-app advertising options for clients to promote their products and services to users.
  - **Native / Banner Ads**: Display ads within the app's content, such as news feeds.
  - **Rewarded Ads**: Offer rewards to users for watching ads (e.g., in-app currency, discounts).
- **Service Directory**: A directory of integrated services and apps for users to explore and access.
- **User Dashboard**: A centralised dashboard for users to manage their preferences, settings, and connected apps.
- **Client Dashboard**: A centralised dashboard for clients to manage their integration settings, content, and advertising campaigns.

It must be noted that the success of this integration hub model would depend on the willingness of businesses and government departments to integrate their apps with the platform. Additionally, while the cost of developing such a platform may be lower than creating an all-in-one app, maintaining and updating the platform would require ongoing resources and support for onboarding new clients.

## Revenue Models

To ensure the financial sustainability of the app, it is essential to explore potential revenue models. It is expected that the major sources of revenue would come from the sponsors, who are local businesses, service providers, employers, and government departments interested in reaching and serving the international student market in Australia. International students, being the primary users of the app, can access the app free of charge.

For the integration hub model, the two services that could be monetised are API access and in-app advertising, as outlined in the following sections.

### API Access

Access to the app's API could use a usage-based pricing model, where clients get charged based on the number of API calls or data transactions they, or their users, make.

Tiered pricing plans could be offered to cater to different client sizes and usage levels. An example pricing structure could be as follows:

| Number of API Calls | Price (per thousand calls) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - 10,000 | $1 |
| 10,001 - 100,000 | $0.8 |
| 100,001 - 1,000,000 | $0.6 |
| Over 1,000,000 | $0.4 |

Of course, these prices are indicative and would need to be refined based on market research and competitor analysis. The goal is to strike a balance between affordability for clients and profitability for the app.

### Marketing and Promotion

In-app advertising could be another significant source of revenue for the app. By allowing sponsors to place targeted ads within the app, the app could generate revenue based on engagement metrics such as views, clicks or acquisitions.

The following table outlines the potential pricing options for in-app advertising, inspired by [Facebook's pricing model](https://www.webfx.com/social-media/pricing/how-much-does-facebook-advertising-cost/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20people%20can%20pay%20the%20following%20for,per%20like%204%20%240.00%20%E2%80%93%20%245.00%20per%20download):

| Pricing Model | Description | Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost Per View (CPV)** | Advertisers pay for each view of their ad | $2 per 1000 views |
| **Cost Per Click (CPC)** | Advertisers pay for each click on their ad | $0.20 per click |
| **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)** | Advertisers pay for each user acquisition (sign-up) from their ad | $2 per sign-up |
| **Revenue Share** | App shares a percentage of the sponsor's revenue when users make a purchase | 5% of revenue |

A specific pricing model could be agreed upon with sponsors at the time of onboarding, based on their advertising goals and budget. The goal is to provide flexible and cost-effective advertising options that deliver value to both sponsors and users.

### Initial Funding

To kickstart the app's development and launch, beside the company's investment, it is recommended to explore potential funding sources such as government grants, venture capital, or angel investors. These sources could provide the initial capital required to develop the app and attract sponsors, setting the stage for sustainable revenue generation in the long run.

Additionally, partnerships with educational institutions, industry associations, or other stakeholders in the international student market could provide valuable support and resources for the app's development. By leveraging these partnerships, the app could gain access to a wider user base and additional funding opportunities.

## Potential Number of Users and Uptake

As previously mentioned, the potential number of users for the app is significant, with 582,636 enrolments by international students in Australia as of January 2024 and is likely to grow in the coming years based on historical trends. However, predicting the exact uptake of the app before development and release is challenging and would depend on various factors, including market needs, promotion strategies, user experience, and incentives for business owners to adopt the app.

With a conservative estimate of 5-10% uptake in the first year, the app could attract approximately 29,000 to 59,000 users, and potentially more with effective marketing and promotion strategies in place, with a clear performance metric to measure the adoption rate.
